# CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker Class



This interface represents a dedicated worker in WebView2 and provides methods and properties for interacting with it, such as getting the script uri, posting messages and managing events related to the creation of child workers and the worker????????s termination.


## Summary

Members|Description
--|--
[ScriptUri](#scripturi) | A string representing the Uri of the script that the worker is executing.
[PostWebMessageAsJson](#postwebmessageasjson) | Posts the specified `webMessageAsJson` to this worker.
[PostWebMessageAsString](#postwebmessageasstring) | Posts a message that is a simple string rather than a JSON string representation of a JavaScript object.
[DedicatedWorkerCreated](#dedicatedworkercreated) | Subscribe to this event that gets raised when a new dedicated worker is created from a dedicated worker.
[Destroying](#destroying) | Add an event handler for the `CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker.Destroying` event that is raised when the worker object is Destroying. A worker object is Destroying when the worker script is terminated or when the `CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker` object is Destroying.
[WebMessageReceived](#webmessagereceived) | 

## Properties

### ScriptUri

> readonly  string ScriptUri

A string representing the Uri of the script that the worker is executing.

The `scriptUri` is a fully qualified URI, including the scheme, host, and path. In contrast, the `scriptURL` property of the `Worker` object in the DOM returns the relative URL of the script being executed by the worker. For more details on DOM API, see the [DOM API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Worker/scriptURL).

Refer to the [Host Name Canonicalization](#host-name-canonicalization) section for details on how normalization is performed. The same process applies to the `scriptURL` when a worker is created from DOM API. The `scriptUri` property reflects this normalization, ensuring that the URL is standardized. For example, `HTTPS://EXAMPLE.COM/worker.js` is canonicalized to `https://example.com/worker.js`; `https://b????cher.de/worker.js` is canonicalized to `https://xn--bcher-kva.de/worker.js`.




## Methods

### PostWebMessageAsJson

> void PostWebMessageAsJson(string webMessageAsJson)

Posts the specified `webMessageAsJson` to this worker.
The event args is an instance of `MessageEvent`. The [CoreWebView2Settings.IsWebMessageEnabled](corewebview2settings.md#iswebmessageenabled) setting must be `true` or the message will not be sent. The event arg's `data` property of the event arg is the `webMessageAsJson` string parameter parsed as a JSON string into a JavaScript object. The event arg's `source` property of the event arg is a reference to the `self.chrome.webview` object. For information about sending messages from the worker to the host, navigate to [CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker.WebMessageReceived](corewebview2dedicatedworker.md#webmessagereceived). The message is sent asynchronously. If the worker is terminated or destroyed before the message is posted, the message is discarded.
Runs the message event of the `self.chrome.webview` of this worker. Worker Javascript may subscribe and unsubscribe to the event using the following code:
```javascript
self.chrome.webview.addEventListener('message', handler)
self.chrome.webview.removeEventListener('message', handler)
```




### PostWebMessageAsString

> void PostWebMessageAsString(string webMessageAsString)

Posts a message that is a simple string rather than a JSON string representation of a JavaScript object.
This behaves in exactly the same manner as [CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker.PostWebMessageAsJson](corewebview2dedicatedworker.md#postwebmessageasjson), but the `data` property of the event arg of the `self.chrome.webview` message is a string with the same value as `webMessageAsString`. Use this instead of [CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker.PostWebMessageAsJson](corewebview2dedicatedworker.md#postwebmessageasjson) if you want to communicate using simple strings rather than JSON objects.





## Events

### DedicatedWorkerCreated

Subscribe to this event that gets raised when a new dedicated worker is created from a dedicated worker.

A Dedicated Worker is a type of web worker that allow you to run Javascript code in the background without blocking the main thread, making them useful for tasks like heavy computations, data processing, and parallel execution. It is "dedicated" because it is linked to a single parent document and cannot be shared with other scripts.

This event is raised when a web application creates a dedicated worker using the `new Worker("/worker.js")` method. See the [Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker) for more information.


Type: [TypedEventHandler](/uwp/api/Windows.Foundation.TypedEventHandler-2)&lt;CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker, [CoreWebView2DedicatedWorkerCreatedEventArgs](corewebview2dedicatedworkercreatedeventargs.md)&gt;

### Destroying

Add an event handler for the `CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker.Destroying` event that is raised when the worker object is Destroying. A worker object is Destroying when the worker script is terminated or when the `CoreWebView2DedicatedWorker` object is Destroying.
If the worker has already been destroyed before the event handler is registered, the handler will never be called.

### WebMessageReceived
